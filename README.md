=======

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/clementviolet/omnivor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clementviolet/omnivor)

The goal of omnivor is to set up a friendly-user environement for networks analysis in ecology.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of omnivor from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("clementviolet/omnivor")
```

To do
-----

Package structure :

-   \[ \] Adopt a POO structure ;
-   \[ \] Create a vignette.

List of metrics to be added first (Dunne (2009) and, Vermaat *et al.* (2009)) :

-   \[X\] Connectance ;
-   \[ \] Connectance (bipartite network)
-   \[X\] Species richness (number of node) ;
-   \[X\] Linkage density ;
-   \[X\] Clustering coefficient ;
-   \[X\] Characteristic path length ;
-   \[ \] Mean food chain length ;
-   \[ \] Short-weighted trophic level averaged ;
-   \[X\] Percentage of top species in a web ;
-   \[X\] Percentage of basl species in a web ;
-   \[ \] Percentage of intermediate species ;
-   \[ \] Percentage of omnivores in a web ;
-   \[ \] Percentage of detritivores ;
-   \[ \] Normalized standard deviation of generality ;
-   \[ \] Normalized standard deviation of vulnerability ;
-   \[ \] Normalized standard deviation of links ;
-   \[ \] Mean across taxa of the maximum trophic similarity of each taxon to other taxa

List of other metrics to include (Delmas *et al.* (2019)) :
