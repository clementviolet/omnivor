# omnivor
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/clementviolet/omnivor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clementviolet/omnivor)

The goal of omnivor is to set up a friendly-user environement for networks analysis in ecology.

## Installation

You can install the released version of omnivor from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("clementviolet/omnivor")
```
## To do

Package structure :

- [ ] Adopt a POO structure ;
- [ ] Create a vignette.

List of metrics to be added first (Dunne (2009) and, Vermaat *et al.* (2009)) :

- [X] Connectance ;
- [ ] Connectance (bipartite network)
- [X] Species richness (number of node) ;
- [X] Linkage density ;
- [X] Clustering coefficient ;
- [X] Characteristic path length ;
- [X] Mean food chain length ;
- [X] Prey-averaged trophic level ;
- [X] Shortest trophic level ;
- [X] Short-weighted trophic level averaged ;
- [X] Percentage of top species in a web ;
- [X] Percentage of basal species in a web ;
- [X] Percentage of intermediate species ;
- [X] Percentage of canibal species in a web ;
- [X] Percentage of omnivores in a web ;
- [X] Normalized standard deviation of generality ;
- [X] Normalized standard deviation of vulnerability ;
- [X] Normalized standard deviation of links ;
- [ ] Mean across taxa of the maximum trophic similarity of each taxon to other taxa

List of other metrics to include (Delmas *et al.* (2019)) :

- [ ] To be continued...

Others :
