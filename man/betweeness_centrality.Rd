\title{Betweeness centrality}
\usage{
betweeness_centrality(graph, normalized = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{an \code{igraph} object.}

\item{normalized}{\code{logical} should the coefficients be normalized? The formula would be: \deqn{C_{Bnorm} = 2 \times \frac{C_{B}}{(n-1)(n-2)}} Where \eqn{C_{B}} is the betweeness coefficent vector and \eqn{n} is the number of nodes.}

\item{...}{others arguments passed to \code{\link[=betweenness]{igraph::betweenness()}}}
}
\value{
\code{numeric} a vector containing betweeness centrality coefficients for each node.
}
\description{
#' Betweeness centrality is a measure of the number of time a node is between pairs of nodes. The value can be normalized by the number, see details for more informations.
