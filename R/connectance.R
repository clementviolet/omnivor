#' Connectance of a graph
#'
#' Proportion of all possible links that are realized. In a directed unipartite network \eqn{C = \frac{L}{S^2}}, in a directed newtork where species cannot interact with themselves \eqn{C = \frac{L}{S(S-1)}}. In undirected newtork, if species cannot interact with themselves \eqn{C = \frac{L}{S\frac{S-1}{2}}} otherwise \eqn{C = \frac{L}{S\frac{S-1}{2}}}. Where \eqn{L} is the number of links and \eqn{S} the number of species.
#' @param graph an igraph object.
#' @param loops logical: are species able to interact with themselves?
#' @param directed logical: are interactions directed?
#'
#' @return numeric: the value of the connectance.
